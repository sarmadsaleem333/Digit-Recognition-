## Overview

The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that can accurately classify handwritten digits (0-9) from the MNIST dataset. The project involves data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation. The models used include various machine learning and deep learning algorithms.

## Dataset

The MNIST dataset contains 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images of handwritten digits. Each image is 28x28 pixels.


## Usage

1. **Preprocess the data**: Normalize and prepare the dataset for training.
2. **Train the model**: Use various machine learning or deep learning algorithms to train the model.
3. **Evaluate the model**: Assess the performance of the model using test data.
